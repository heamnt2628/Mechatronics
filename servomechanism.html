In control engineering a servomechanism, usually shortened to servo, is an automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the action of a mechanism.
On displacement-controlled applications, it usually includes a built-in encoder or other position feedback mechanism to ensure the output is achieving the desired effect.
The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed, attitude or any other measurable variables.
For example, an automotive power window control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position—the operator does this by observation.
 By contrast a car's cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism.
