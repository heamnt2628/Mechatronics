A control system manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops.
 It can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines. 
The control systems are designed via control engineering process.
For continuously modulated control, a feedback controller is used to automatically control a process or operation. 
The control system compares the value or status of the process variable (PV) being controlled with the desired value or setpoint (SP), and applies the difference as a control signal to bring the process variable output of the plant to the same value as the setpoint.
For sequential and combinational logic, software logic, such as in a programmable logic controller, is used
